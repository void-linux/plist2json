NAME
     plist2json â€“ Converts plist input to json

SYNOPSYS
     plist2json [files.plist | -]

DESCRIPTION
     The plist2json utility converts plist input to json. The plist input can
     be read from the specified file, or directly from stdin.  The resulting
     json output is then printed to stdout.

NOTES
     The plist format expected is not fully compatible with Apple plists, but
     rather it's compatible with the NetBSD's proplib implementation.
